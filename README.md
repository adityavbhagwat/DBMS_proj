- The data gets stored in the students collection of the mongodb database where the password of the user is hashed using bcryptjs
- The admin has the power to register new companies to the database using the (Add new company) tab of their navbar view
- The new company to be registered must also be given a company icon so that it can be displayed on the company tab.


STUDENT DASHBOARD
